fence_ec2 is an I/O Fencing agent which can be used with Amazon EC2 instances.
In order to function, the agent needs the private key and cert used by the Amazon EC2 API.

API functions used by this agent:
- ec2-describe-tags
- ec2-describe-instances
- ec2-stop-instances
- ec2-start-instances
- ec2-reboot-instances

If the uname used by the cluster node is any of:
 - Public DNS name (or part there of),
 - Private DNS name (or part there of),
 - Instance ID (eg. i-4f15a839)
 - Contents of tag associated with the instance
then the agent should be able to automatically discover the instances it can control.

If the tag containing the uname is not [Name], then it will need to be specified using the [tag] option.
